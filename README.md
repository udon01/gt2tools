# gt2tools
This is a fork of the pez2k code.
Rules by pez2k (also a memo)
My only requests if you do use the code are to keep any modifications open-source so that others can build on it and the knowledge is never lost, to mention me in any release credits if possible, and to make it clear to any users that I can't provide any support for it.
(日本語訳)もしあなたがコードを使うなら、他の人がそれを基に構築でき、知識が決して失われないように、どんな修正もオープンソースに保つこと、可能ならどんなリリースクレジットでも私に言及すること、そして私がそれに対してどんなサポートも提供できないことをどんなユーザーにも明らかにすることが私の要求です。

The following is the original statement of the fork.
All of the Gran Turismo related tooling and research code written by pez2k, sometimes based on code or research by adeyblue, Leo2236, Xenn, Submaniac, and others.

Not all projects do something useful, and not all code is clean and readable, depending on how quickly it was put together. Some projects have also been superceded by rewritten or more functional equivalents. Please see the releases for pre-built binaries of any useful tooling.

If using any of this code or research for other projects, please let me (pez2k) know, as I'd be interested to see what it's useful for.
